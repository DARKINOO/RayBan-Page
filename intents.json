To perform a motor test, you typically use your flight controller software like Inav / Betaflight or a dedicated motor testing tool to manually spin each motor at various speeds. This allows you to verify that each motor responds correctly to throttle inputs and that they are all spinning in the correct direction to generate the desired thrust. Always perform motor tests in a safe environment with the propellers removed to prevent accidents."],
